My name is Dixon Martinez, i am passionate about programming, born the need to create my personal blog, share my knowledge and support those who start in this area.

After evaluating different platforms to start with the publications, I decided to work with [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/), which allows me to manage my post and host [github.com/](https://github.com/) servers.
